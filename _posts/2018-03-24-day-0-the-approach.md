Hello all,

Today is the big day!
Atlanta has been a fun, culturally rich, and good-beer-and-music-having place to spend our final pre-trail living, it's time to go.

Soon Jason and I will begin the 8 mile uphill trek to the summit of Springer Mountain, which marks the start of the Appalachian Trail. Along the way we can expect to marvel at discarded "shakedown" items from past thru-starters, and meet some of our new community for the next 6 months. Yes, I am bringing a Peacemaker for a kickoff summit toast.

Big thanks to all you friends and family who have supported, advised, helped prepare, or simply wished well and happy trails. I'd still be in Austin without you.
