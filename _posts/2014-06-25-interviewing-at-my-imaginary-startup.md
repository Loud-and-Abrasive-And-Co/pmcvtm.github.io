### Colour By Numbers

I'm sure I'm not alone in the ocassional musings of what running a company would be like. Not doing any work, sitting around while the money stacks up... That would be the life. But company culture can be even more important than whatever you're doing (I mean, who really cares about that?) I was recently inspired by [this interesting post](http://blog.42floors.com/interviewing-at-a-startup/) to consider what interviewing for my future dream-startup-cash-machine might be like. Enjoy.

#### Dress Appropriately
You need a beard. We'll pay for plugs if needed once you start, but paint one or wear some horse hair for the interview. Suits are recommended, but don't wear a dress shirt if you do. On that note, wearing the jersey of a team we don't like _instead_ of a dress shirt is worse than a dress shirt. Partial or full nudity is not just accepted, but encouraged, regardless of body type. We're forward-thinking like that.

#### Dedicate Your Day
We told you on the phone the interview would only take an hour or two, but let's be real. If you're going to be spending 8-10 hours a day here after you're hired, you might as well give it a trial run on the day of the interview. Here, file these papers while you're at it. 

#### Be an Expert
Regardless of your last job and the years you've spent learning and mastering your field, you should already know at least half of that level about _our_ business, practices, and the specific technologies we use. It proves you've got your foot in the door. And don't try to tell me you're a fast learner; you would already know it all if that were true. You will be quizzed.

#### Read Our Blog
Cause if you aren't, who is?

#### Bribe Me
Not the rest of the company, just me. Making the boss feel important is the key to a well-run business. Being a good fit? More like bringing a food gift. And make the checks out to cash, please.

#### Know What's Coming
It's the future. Everything about our hiring process is on Glassdoor, Coderwall, Website.2033, and even our careers page. Our expectation is that you'll know ahead of time what the next steps are, and whether or not you'll be taking them.

#### Go Above and Beyond
If you think what it says on our website about interviewing is it, you're an unimaginative non-creative, and we don't want anything to do with you. For instance, part of our interview offical process is a pitcher of beer and game of shuffleboard with the CEO (but don't tell our investors). You're expected to buy a round of shots or call one of us 'asshole', bring in a zany invention, or maybe do a silly dance. I won't give you too many ideas or it will be too easy.

#### Know Us Personally
If we receive a resume from you, and you're not connected with us on a single social media network, how do we know you care about us, on a personal level? Even a simple tweet, facebook message, or letter written in blood would show you've at least thought about what being our pal would be like. So far, we've only hired our friends, and we think that's a safe and sustainable form of growth, don't you?

As you can see, working for me would be fun, exciting, and interesting. And not too difficult to get started. See you in the future, prospective new-hire.
