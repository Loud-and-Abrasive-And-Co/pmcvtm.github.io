Luchador figure similar in design to [El Prototipo]({% post_url 2014-07-12-el-prototipo %}) but decorated with the leafy green box art from Sierra Nevada's _Torpedo_ IPA to best represent "The Mighty Oak." Unlike El Prototipo, El Roble Poderoso has trouble standing on his own two feet, so he has a nice gynmists's stand to lean on. This was entered into an art contest for City of Austin employees and their families. It did not win.
