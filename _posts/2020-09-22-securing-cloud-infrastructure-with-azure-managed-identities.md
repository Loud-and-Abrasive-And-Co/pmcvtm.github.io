Managed Identities are system-managed service principals that allow for a level of security control I hadn't considered before, where keys and passwords can be 'eliminated' or rotated so frequently that **no human** has (at-ready) access to resources, without requiring (even automated) code or configuration changes for applications. They are _super_ easy to set up in .NET Core, and I recently layed out how for Headspring's "Developer Corner"
