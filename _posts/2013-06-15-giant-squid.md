This 'Jules Vernian' giant is made from full-width corrugated 12-pack boxes. Specifically Shiner Ruby Redbird (a summer favorite) and the Boulevard brewing mix-12, which also contains some choice brews. Boulevard's boxes are also great for colorful storage. One of my largest pieces, and the first to include 'exposed' corrugation as an intentional detail.
