## Thanks For Dropping By

Hello,

I'm doing one of those lame obligatory first post on this blog. I've had many websites and portfolios over the years and even just recently began, ditched, and have now returned to a blog on Github Pages. I prefer the CMS style, so I'm giving [the Ghost](https://ghost.org/) a go. You can see my fork of [the Azure-Ghost on Github](https://github.com/pmcvtm/Ghost-Azure).

**Update Feb. 2017: I'm back to Github pages.**

By tuning in to Loud &amp; Abrasive, you can expect some very cool stuff: 

* Technical blog posts of all shapes and sizes
* Weird art I make
* Updates and retrospectives of personal projects
* A link to [homestarrunner.com](http://www.homestarrunner.com)


Take a click around, if you find something broken, missing, or otherwise improvable please let me know by emailing me at <p.mcvtm@gmail.com>, tweeting at me [@loudandabrasive](http://twitter.com/loudandabrasive), or by leaving a comment below. I'm particularly curious how it ends up looking on the mobiles.

See y'all again soon,
