I am very happy to announce that I am the host of Headspring's new podcast _OK Human_, an exploration of technology, developing, and consulting through the lenses of humanity and emotion. Look forward to discussions on work strategy, organization, empathy, and how change can impact us as people while we make (or support making) software.
