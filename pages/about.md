## _Positivum spirituum, utile iubilo_

<img style="float:left; margin-right: 1rem;" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50f4741321b7937a870a280e11a0fea5" alt="our author: a young-ish man in aviator eyeglasses with sunglass flip-ups donning a jovial smile" />

Patrick McVeety-Mill is a professional software developer and amateur a lot of other things, originally from and currently residing in Austin, TX. After a frigid foray in academics at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Patrick has been delivering tip-top code, collaborating and mentoring his team, and keeping clients satisfied as a senior consultant at [Headspring](https://headspring.com/) since 2012. A gracious leave of absence in 2018 allowed him to achieve his long-time dream of thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail in its entirety.

Behind the keyboard, Patrick works with a spread of technologies, from classics like C#, .NET and hep javascript frameworks, to more buzzwordy fields like cloud, dev ops and microservices, and F# and applying functional concepts to make cleaner code in any context. No matter the tools, he's as engaged in learning and sharing as in doing.

Away from the keyboard, Patrick makes cardboard sculptures, swims, bowls, cycles, backpacks, enjoys live music, and shoots breeze over beers with friend, family, and stranger. Give him a shout via the social medias linked in the footer.
