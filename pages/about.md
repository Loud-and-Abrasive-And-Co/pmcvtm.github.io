## _Positivum spiritus, utile iubilo_

<img style="float:left; margin-right: 1rem;" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50f4741321b7937a870a280e11a0fea5" alt="our author: a youngish man donning a jovial smile" />

Patrick McVeety-Mill is a professional software developer and amateur a lot of other things, originally from and currently residing in Austin, TX. After a frigid foray in academics at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Patrick has been delivering tip-top code, collaborating and mentoring his team, and keeping clients satisfied as a senior consultant at Headspring since 2012. A gracious leave of absence in 2018 allowed him to achieve his long-time dream of hiking the Appalachian Trail in its entirety.

Behind the keyboard, Patrick works with a spread of technologies, from classics like C#, MVC, and hep javascript frameworks, to more buzzwordy fields like cloud, dev ops and microservices, and most recently F#, and how functional ideas to make cleaner code in all languages. No matter the tools, he's as engaged in learning and sharing as in doing.

Away from the keyboard, Patrick makes cardboard sculptures, swims, bowls, backpacks, enjoys live music, and cracks wise over beer with friend, foe, and stranger alike. Give him a shout via the social medias linked in the footer.
