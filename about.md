## Positivum spiritus, utile iubilo

Patrick McVeety-Mill is a professional software developer and amateur a lot of other things, originally from and currently residing in Austin, TX. After a frigid forray in academics at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Patrick has been delivering tip-top code, collaborating and mentoring his team, and keeping clients satisfied as a senior consultant at Headspring for the past 5 years.

Behind the keyboard, Patrick works with a spread of technologies, from classics like C#, MVC, and hep JS frameworks, to more buzzwordy fields like cloud (Azure), mobile (Xamarin), microservices, and most recently F#, and how functional ideas to make cleaner code in all languages. No matter the tools, he's as engaged in learning and sharing as in doing.

Away from the keyboard, Patrick makes cardboard sculptures, cycles, swims, bowls, backpacks, and cracks wise over beer with friend, foe, and stranger alike. Give him a shout via the social medias linked in the footer.
